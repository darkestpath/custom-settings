The Ultimate Multiboot Guide

- One HDD
- MBR Partition Scheme

1. Check System
----------------
To create a Multiboot System 
First we need to check if we have UEFI or Legacy

> Usually UEFI goes with GPT Partitions table
> Legacy goes with MBR Partitions table


2. Partition Tools
--------------------------------
To create a partiton table 
> i recommand using Gparted for this, you can get gparted iso to live boot
> or you can use any linux Distro live boot iso
> or if you are installing windows too then you can use command line tool.



3. Layout of partitions
-----------------------

|--Primary--||-------------Extended-------------|
_________________________________________________
|  windows	||	files	||	linux-1	|	linux-2	|
|  P(70GB)	||	L(-)	||	L(50GB)	|	L(50GB)	|
_________________________________________________

P = Parimary Partition
L = Logical Partition

> in MBR, there can only be 4 primary partitions.
> Or there can be 3 primary partitions and one extended partition.
> Logical Partitions are inside the Extended Partiton.

####

This layout is designed in a way that you can expand the partitions
and can create as many as paritionns you want after the files partiton.

You just need to shrink the files partition to create a room for other
partition and if you dont want the partion then simply delete the partition 
and add it to the files partiton.
But you can do this to only the partition that is just after the files partition.

The recommanded sizes are shown in the layout.
Note that files partition size can very on how space is used for other partitions.


--------- Tips -----------

Install windows First (which is, if you install)

---------------------------

If you have multiboot with Windows then
> Disable the fast boot option in windows 10.

(it causes the to partitons in linux to mount as read only
and you cant write and create files and folders in partitions)

control center > power option > show unavilable options > turn off fastboot
